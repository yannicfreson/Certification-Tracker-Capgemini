# Certification Tracker - Capgemini

### Getting started

#### Step 1: Clone the repository

#### step 2: set up the database connection

To acces the database, you need to copy the `firebaseConfig.example.js` file and rename it to `firebaseConfig.js`. Then, you need to fill in the values with the ones from your Firebase project.

#### Step 3: Install the dependencies and run the project

```bash
# install the necessary dependencies
npm i
# run the project
npm run dev
```

#### Step 4:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result. The page will reload automatically when you make changes to the code.

#### Note:

We're using the mobile first approach, so for now you can use the device toolbar in your browser to see how the project would look on mobile. Later on, we'll add layouts for bigger screens.
