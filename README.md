# Certification Tracker - Capgemini

### Getting started

#### Step 1: Clone the repository

#### Step 2: Install the dependencies

```bash
# install the necessary dependencies
npm i
```

#### step 3: Set up the database connection

To acces the database, you need to copy the **_`firebaseConfig.example.js`_** file and rename it to **_`firebaseConfig.js`_**. Then, you need to fill in the values with the ones from your Firebase project.
**The** **_`firebaseConfig.js`_** **file is in the .gitignore but verify that you NEVER commit this**

#### Step 4: Run the project

```bash
# run the project
npm run dev
```

#### Step 5: View the project

Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser to see the result. The page will reload automatically when you make changes to the code.

#### Note:

We're using the mobile first approach, so for now you can use the device toolbar in your browser to see how the project would look on mobile. Later on, we'll add layouts for bigger screens.
